# Royal Blackjack Casino - Supabase Auth Setup

This guide explains how to set up the Supabase authentication system with age verification (21+) and country validation for the Royal Blackjack Casino application.

## Prerequisites

1. A Supabase account and project
2. Access to the Supabase dashboard for your project
3. Basic knowledge of SQL and Supabase

## Schema Setup Instructions

### 1. Run SQL Migration

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to the "SQL Editor" section
3. Click "New Query"
4. Copy and paste the contents of the `supabase-schema.sql` file from this repository
5. Click "Run" to execute the SQL

This script will:
- Create the `countries` table with country codes and age restrictions
- Create the `user_profiles` table with age verification (21+ requirement)
- Create the `user_preferences` table for user settings
- Set up appropriate relationships between tables
- Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies

### 2. Configure Supabase Auth

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to "Authentication" â†’ "Settings"
2. Under "Email Auth", make sure "Enable Email Signup" is checked
3. If you want to require email verification (recommended):
   - Check "Enable email confirmations"
   - Set "Mailer" to your preferred email service

### 3. Update Environment Variables

Ensure your application's environment variables are properly configured to connect to Supabase:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

## Age Verification Implementation

The schema includes several levels of age verification:

1. **Frontend validation**:
   - The sign-up form validates that users are at least 21 years old
   - Uses client-side JavaScript to check date of birth

2. **Database constraints**:
   - The `user_profiles` table has a check constraint to ensure date_of_birth is at least 21 years ago
   - This adds server-side validation as a second layer of security

3. **Country-based age restrictions**:
   - The `countries` table includes a `min_age` field to support different age restrictions by country
   - This allows for region-specific compliance

## Country Validation

Countries are stored in a dedicated table with:
- ISO country codes
- Country names
- An `allowed` flag to control which countries can access the platform
- Country-specific minimum age requirements

## Testing the Setup

After running the migration:

1. Try to create a new user through your application's sign-up form
2. Verify that users under 21 cannot sign up
3. Check that the country selection is working properly
4. Confirm that the user's profile data is properly saved in the `user_profiles` table

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **SQL Migration Errors**:
   - Check for syntax errors in the SQL
   - Make sure the tables don't already exist

2. **Auth Signup Problems**:
   - Verify your Supabase project's auth settings
   - Check that email sending is properly configured

3. **Profile Creation Failures**:
   - Look for constraint violations (e.g., duplicate usernames)
   - Check that the age validation is working properly

## Security Considerations

- The schema enforces Row Level Security (RLS) so users can only access their own data
- Age verification is enforced both client-side and server-side
- Country restrictions allow compliance with regional gambling laws

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. Consider adding additional verification methods (ID verification, etc.)
2. Implement admin panel for managing country restrictions
3. Set up monitoring and alerts for suspicious signup patterns
